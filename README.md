## HealthVault: Patient - Centered Healthcare on Blockchain
We're building for a future where your health data belongs to you

Developed for the Legal Tech Hackathon 2025.

## Overview
HealthVault is a blockchain-based platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to solve healthcare data fragmentation. The platform gives patients full control of their medical records, enabling secure, encrypted, and permission-based data sharing with healthcare providers across institutions.

With Internet Identity authentication and advanced encryption, patients can manage their complete health history diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, and vaccinations in one place. Real-time access control allows patients to decide who can view their data and for how long.

Designed for interoperability and future healthcare needs, HealthVault creates a decentralized, transparent, and patient-owned health data ecosystem that improves medical outcomes and strengthens trust between patients and providers.

## Value Proposition
- Unique Use Case: Patient-centric medical data ownership using decentralized Web3 technologies.
- Real-World Impact: Reduces diagnostic errors and delays through unified, controlled access to records.
- Monetization Potential: Future revenue through B2B SaaS model for healthcare institutions and premium identity integrations.

## Core Features
For Patients
- Full Data Ownership: Patients control their entire medical history, stored securely on blockchain.
- Zero Data Loss: All records encrypted and permanently available, immune to tampering or deletion.
- Granular Access Control: Decide which doctor can access what data, and for how long.
- Internet Identity Login: Passwordless authentication with biometrics and device-based identity.
- Unified Health Record: Consolidates prescriptions, lab results, imaging, vaccination, and medical history into one place.
- Emergency Mode: Temporary access for emergency doctors when patients cannot give consent manually.

For Doctors & Hospitals
- Instant Data Access: With patient approval, doctors get accurate, real-time medical history.
- Interoperability Tools: Easy integration with existing hospital systems (EHR/EMR) via APIs.
- Lower Operational Costs: No need for expensive custom data storage—use secure blockchain infrastructure.
- Audit Trail: Transparent log of all data access, ensuring trust and accountability.
- Research Access (with patient consent): Anonymized datasets for clinical research and trials.
- Future-Proof Architecture: Ready for telemedicine, AI diagnostics, and global interoperability.


## Technical Architecture
### Frontend – User Interface (React + TailwindCSS)

Language: JavaScript (React) + TailwindCSS

Key Components:
App.jsx
- Root component managing page routing and layout structure
main.jsx
- Application root file, responsible for rendering App.jsx
index.css & tailwind.config.js
- TailwindCSS styling
- Responsive and modern UI design

Frontend Responsibilities:
- Interact with the backend canister using JavaScript bindings
- Provide smooth UX for login, viewing, creating, and managing access to records

Configuration & Integration
dfx.json
- Canister configuration for Internet Computer (defines canisters, language, etc.)
package.json
- Dependency management for React frontend and TailwindCSS


### Backend – Smart Contract (Motoko)

Language: Motoko

Key Components:
main.mo – Core Smart Contract:
- Stores all data in a StableBTreeMap (persistence across upgrades/restarts)
- Handles access authorization using Internet Computer’s Principal ID
- Exposes interface to frontend via .did (Candid interface)

Core Responsibilities:
- Secure storage and retrieval of patient medical records
- CRUD operations for medical data
- Access control system based on Principal ID (Internet Identity)

## Getting Started
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
1. Node.js and npm Installation

First, install Node.js which includes npm package manager:
- Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en) and download the LTS version
- Verify installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
2. DFX (Internet Computer SDK) Setup

We will be using Dfinity's dfx for our development environment.
1.	Install DFX: Follow the instructions on [Dfinity's SDK documentation.](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install)
2.	Verify DFX installation:
```bash
dfx --version
```

## Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd HealthVault
```
2. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary Node.js packages for the frontend:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start DFX Local Network
Start the DFX replica in the background:
```bash
dfx start --background
```
4. Deploy Canisters
Deploy all canisters and generate the Candid interface:
```bash
dfx deploy
```
5. Generate Candid Interface
If you make changes to the backend, regenerate the Candid interface:
```bash
npm run generate
```
6. Start Development Server
Launch the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting
DFX not starting:
```bash
dfx stop
dfx start --clean --background
```
Canister deployment fails:
```bash
dfx canister delete --all
dfx deploy
```
Frontend build errors:
```bash
npm run generate
npm start
```

## HealthVault Roadmap
